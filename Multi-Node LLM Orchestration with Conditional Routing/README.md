# ARTICLE GENERATOR: Multi-Node LLM Orchestration with Conditional Routing

This project demonstrates a multi-node workflow orchestration using **LangGraph**'s `StateGraph` to manage a pipeline involving:

- Intro, Body, and Conclusion nodes  
- Conditional routing to respective LLM processing nodes  
- Compilation and final LLM processing  
- Visualizing the workflow graph

## Features

- Modular node-based workflow  
- Conditional edges based on custom assignment functions  
- Graph compilation for execution  
- Workflow visualization with Mermaid diagrams
